# Swiss Beach Tournament
This web app is the extension of a [swiss-system tournament](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament) for beach-volleyball.
Usually, the swiss-system is applied in chess or other sports when the number of players can be large.
This implementation of the swiss-system is developed for beach-volleyball tournaments where a team consists of two players and teams are mixed after each match.
This allows for having 'open' tournaments with no limit of rounds and how many people one meets.
